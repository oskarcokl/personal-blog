It's the end of the work day and I can do nothing but blankly stare at the computer monitor in a catatonic state.

A week has gone by since l had my ["oh fuck"](https://ghuntley.com/oh-fuck/) moment with AI and started to dive deeper into it. It's been so much fucking FUN, I made a snake game in win32 and then ported it to the web using emscripten and a bunch of other throw away projects all without writing any code.

I had only scratched the surface, it was like discovering my new favorite video game and I spent the next few days reading and learning everything I could.

But with all of the excitement also came, exhaustion. Waking up at 5am to work on this might have been part of it, but I feel like there is something else brewing.

Its like, even though the AI gives you these great capabilities and you can complete work much faster, the amount of work is still endless, so you just end up doing more of it. And even though I can describe the feature and the AI will implement it (most of the time) I still have to think up the feature, think of how to describe it to the AI and on top of that I'm also trying different models and tools and comparing results... ugghhh. The productivity gains are definitely there, but if you are invested and trying to keep up it is also really tiring. It feels kinda like being spoiled for choice in an extremely fatiguing way. Like you have an isle full of candies and you can try them all free of charge, your stomach's going to hurt and your gonna feels sick. So maybe it's time to slow down a little and focus.

p. s. I walked away from the computer for like 5 mins and, actually the feeling I have is very familiar to me and I know what it is now. It's the same feeling I get when a new PoE league launches and I play for 10hrs straight or I get hooked on a new hobby, it's plain old fatigue. And it happens when I hyper-fixate on something and spend every living moment thinking, researching, talking or doing it. So yeah it's time for a little  break...
